----------------

### Issues

1. No splash screen or intro, game starts without warning
2. Game play begins without user input
3. Sounds and music are missing
4. Hero can jump in midair
5. Hero survives dropping below the bottom of the screen
6. Scoreboard not reporting
7. Giant doesn't accept meal upon delivery
8. Strange hopping motion when hero is nearly off the plate
9. "Jump" is more like move up, gravity physics for falling don't work well

### Questions

1. Can player "drop" off of a plate with down arrow?
2. How far can player step off of plate without falling?
 * Some gaps look like player could fall through, but doesn't
